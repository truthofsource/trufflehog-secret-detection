# Local validation — November 6, 2026

**Terms used here:** A fixture is test data or a test setup used instead of real business records.

| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Original input/output rule tests | 21 passed; 2 optional integration cases skipped in the default suite |
| Demo | Actual parser/decision code exercised with explicitly fictional inputs |
| Browser | Three strength cards, all tabs and 390px layout passed |
| Browser isolation | Zero external requests and zero page errors |
| Workflow | Manual public validation; no hosted dispatch |

One separately executed pinned-container history test passed: an unregistered generated test key was committed and removed in a disposable repository, and the scanner found its historical occurrence. No raw key/output is retained publicly. The native CLI integration remains unrun.

[Machine-readable results](validation-results.json) record exact scope. Historical November 5 platform findings are separate from November 6 public examples. Trivy's local vulnerability result used an existing database with updates disabled. Checkov's direct local scan used the existing selected Linux tooling with network none. The original Checkov wrapper is exercised by contracts; the fresh fixture scanner invocation was direct and its report was then validated by that wrapper's actual parser.

No Terraform apply, Azure query/start, credential-provider verification, release, package repair in the private platform or hosted Actions run occurred. Pure tests are not proof of deployed image freshness, full-history coverage outside the selected source, or live cloud compliance.

## Troubleshooting documentation review — November 7, 2026

Added a README incident summary and a linked historical lessons guide, checking the account against the maintained source records. Documentation checks covered local links, complete incident fields, identifying-information patterns, whitespace and preservation of the existing four-step walkthrough. Shared incidents link to the relevant project details; unresolved causes remain explicit.

This was an editorial update. Application code, tests, Terraform, images, workflow definitions and cloud settings were not changed. Existing functional test counts and screenshots above retain their original scope and dates; no application suite, live scan, paid image request, recovery rehearsal or GitHub Actions run was executed for this documentation pass.

## Tools and utilities documentation review — November 7, 2026

Added a prominent README table naming the relevant tools/services and their jobs. The wording distinguishes actual platform components, operating utilities, selected source adapters, optional preparation and local teaching examples. Relevant step headings name their tools while the four-step order and explanatory sentences remain unchanged.

This editorial pass did not change application code, dependencies, infrastructure, workflows or cloud settings. Existing tests and screenshots retain their original evidence scope; no application suite, live scanner, browser sign-in, paid request or GitHub Actions run was executed for this wording update.
